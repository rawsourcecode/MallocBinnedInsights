# [WIP] MallocBinnedInsights
Inspector for the MallocBinned2 memory allocator used in Unreal Engine, MB3 and MBGPU won't be supported.

This is an exploratory exercise to understand the Unreal Insights framework and how to attach new tooling into the ecosystem, currently this is just the simpler boilerplate to 
inject a new window into the insights tool, will add useful things in the future hopefully.

Study notes for MB2 are illustrated at my [blog post](https://rawsourcecode.io/posts/illustrated-overview-mb2-allocator-part-1).
